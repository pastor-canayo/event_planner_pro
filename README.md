# Issues that I was not able to get done
* Not able to use the static website generator to add the blog for the website.  I tried to integrate it only one part with JeKyll
  but I was not able to.  The only way to accomplish that I think it was integrating the whole website with Jekyll but I did not do it
  I just could no find a way to only do a section.  Also I tried the usung Hugo but it did not provide that option neither.
* Also I tried to register the website with google Search Console for the sitemap.xml but it did not recognize the website URL from Nettlify.
  The file sitemap.xml is on the repository.
